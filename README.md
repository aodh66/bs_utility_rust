# The Rust Backup & Save Utility
This is a rewrite of the [BS_Utility](https://github.com/aodh66/bs_utility) written in Rust for 'blazingly fast' performance, and to learn more about the language. It's written with Tauri handling cross platform compatibility, and standard TypeScript handling the frontend UI.

# Tauri + Vanilla TS

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri in vanilla HTML, CSS and Typescript.
